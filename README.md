Question1_ControlledMultiplicationLoop.py

Implements a controlled multiplication loop that multiplies consecutive integers starting from 1 until the product exceeds a predefined threshold. The program prints the final product and the integer that caused the threshold to be exceeded.

Question2_CreateDictionaryFromStrings.py

Defines a function that takes a list of strings and returns a nested dictionary. Each string maps to a dictionary containing the string’s length and whether that length is even or odd.

Question3_ExponentialCalculatorWithOnlyPositives.py

Defines a function to compute 
𝑥
𝑦
x
y
. The program iterates through a list of (x, y) pairs using argument unpacking, skips pairs with negative exponents, and stores valid results in a list that is printed at the end.

Question4_SortedSearchWithConditions.py

Generates a list of random values between 0 and 1, sorts the list, and finds all indices where the values are greater than or equal to a randomly generated value x. The sorted list, x, and the first matching index (if any) are printed.

Question5_CircleAreaOverlap.py

Defines a function that validates two circle radii, computes their areas, and returns the percentage of the larger circle’s area that can be covered by the smaller circle. If invalid input is provided, a meaningful message is returned.

Question6_DistributionAnalysis.py

Defines a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a dictionary where each key is a unique number and each value is the percentage of elements less than or equal to that number. The resulting dictionary is sorted by key before being returned.

Question7_TimeConversion.py

Defines a function that converts a number of seconds since midnight into hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM format. The function returns a formatted string or an error message for invalid input.

Question8_PandasDataFrame.py

Uses the pandas library to create a DataFrame from provided data, computes a new column derived from existing columns, and prints the final DataFrame.
